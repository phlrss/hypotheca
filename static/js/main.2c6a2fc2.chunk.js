The loan is generally paid off over many years and the property is used as security."},mortgagePayment:{question:"What is the composition of a mortgage payment?",answer:"Mortgages are repaid at regular intervals and are composed of both interest and principal. When a mortgage payment is made, the interest due on the principal is serviced first, and the remainder is allocated to the repayment of principal."},frequencyOptions:{question:"What payment frequency options do I have?",answer:"The default mortgage payment frequency is monthly. In Canada, there are six mortgage payment options available: Monthly, semi monthly, bi-weekly, accelerated bi-weekly, weekly, and accelerated weekly."},monthly:{question:"What is the monthly mortgage payment option?",answer:"12 payments are made each year. The mortgage is paid once per month, on the same day each month."},semimonthly:{question:"What is the semi monthly mortgage payment option?",answer:"24 payments are made each year. The mortgage is paid twice a month, either on the 1st and 15th or on the 16th and at the last day of the month. The total amount paid each year amounts to the same as the monthly option."},biweekly:{question:"What is the bi-weekly mortgage payment option?",answer:"26 payments are made each year. The mortgage is paid every two weeks. The total amount paid per year amounts to the same as the monthly option."},accbiweekly:{question:"What is the accelerated bi-weekly mortgage payment option?",answer:"26 payments are made each year. The mortgage is paid every two weeks. The payment amount is calculated by taking the monthly payment divided by two, amounting to approximately one extra payment made per year compared to the monthly option. Note: The accelerated option is an effective way to direct mortgage payments directly to the repayment of principal."},weekly:{question:"What is the weekly mortgage payment option?",answer:"52 payments are made each year. The mortgage is paid every week. The total amount paid per year amounts to the same as the monthly option."},accweekly:{question:"What is the accelerated weekly mortgage payment option?",answer:"52 payments are made each year. The mortgage is paid every week. The payment amount is calculated by taking the monthly payment divided by four, amounting to approximately one extra payment made per year compared to the monthly option. Note: The accelerated option is an effective way to direct mortgage payments directly to the repayment of principal."},interestRate:{question:"What is an annual interest rate?",answer:"The stated rate offered by financial institutions, which is compounded semi-annually."},compounding:{question:"What does semi-annual compounding mean?",answer:"Semi-annual compounding is a term describing the interest factor charge, which is once every six months. The more frequent the compounding period, the higher the interest."},compoundReason:{question:"Why are mortgage interest rates compounded semi-annually?",answer:"By law, fixed rate mortgages in Canada are compounded semi-annually."},amortization:{question:"What is an amortization schedule?",answer:"An amortization schedule shows each mortgage payment and the amount of that payment allocated to principal (the balance owing) and the amount of that payment allocated to interest. Paying down the principal as quickly as possible reduces the amount of interest paid."},amortVsTerm:{question:"What is the difference between the amortization period and the mortgage term?",answer:"An amortization term represents the entire life of the mortgage, which can range from 10, 20, 25 or even 35 years, depending on the circumstances. In other words, an amortization period is the length of time needed to repay the mortgage loan. A mortgage term is the length of time that a mortgage agreement is in effect at an agreed upon interest rate. Common mortgage terms are 1-year, 3-years, and 5-years. At the end of each mortgage term, the mortgage is renewed to a new term until it is fully repaid."},saveMoney:{question:"How can I save money on my mortgage?",answer:"Making additional lump-sum payments on the mortgage will allow for interest savings on interest by the early repayment of principal."},lumpSum:{question:"Should I made additional lump-sum payments on my mortgage?",answer:"By reducing the principal, savings on the interest will be beneficial.
